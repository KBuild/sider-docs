We provide [Sider Enterprise Configuration Helper](https://github.com/sider/enterprise-config) to help you to configure Sider Enterprise.
It contains a quickstart package to help you to give Sider Enterprise a try.
The quickstart package assumes:

- You use Docker Compose to run Sider Enterprise.
- You run all of your components of Sider Enterprise on single computer.

The helper also contains a configuration file generator, which helps you to write the configuration files.
